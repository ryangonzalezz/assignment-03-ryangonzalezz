## Introduction

Todo lists are like a "right of passage" in webdev tutorials. A simple Todo list app can be written in a couple dozen lines of code. There is, however, a huge opportunity for innovation, enhancements and features that can take this project from a learning opportunity to a showcase you put on a portfolio.

Your Assignment 03 involves building and shipping an awesome and innovative Todo list app, as well as doing a basic code review on a team member's submission.

All of your work must be submitted to your assignment 03 GitHub repository, and must be hosted through GitHub pages.
